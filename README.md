# Image Colouring

Project developed by Alejandro Cano Caldero and Jesús Moncada Ramírez for the subject Neural Networks and Deep Learning, University of Padova, 2022-23.

## 1. Abstract
We present a method so as to tackle the image recoloring problem, that is to say, assigning RGB values to grayscale pixels. Not only will this paper show how this problem can be handled by implementing a UNET Autoencoder and Patch GAN, but it will also showcase an important enhancement provided by additional perceptual losses and the implementation of a W-GAN network with \textit{gradient penalty}. These tools will prove to match human perception well and give higher stability to the training model, respectively. To visualize the progress that has been made, we will gradually attach the refinements previously mentioned and the given results to show how the final implementation outperforms the rest.
